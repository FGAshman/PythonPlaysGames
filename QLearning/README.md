# Q learning
Learning about Q-learning and Deep Q-learning Networks (DQNs) using tutorials from Sentdex on youtube (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDezJFIOU5wDdfy4e9vdnx-7)

DQN.py has not currently been tested due to hardware limitations on my laptop, will be ran properly in a few days when I have access to my PC with better GPUs. Is also currently compatible with tensorflow 1.13.1, and keras 2.2.4. Will have to implement changes for compatibility with Tensorflow 2.0
